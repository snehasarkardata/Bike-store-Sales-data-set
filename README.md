2 FILE - coding part
In initial step I Import 4 liabraries such as panda as pd for analysis and manuplation, matplotlib.pyplot as plt for create the plot, numpy as np for mathematical operations. Thereafter I import my data set name as 'Sales dataset'. Afterthat we check the shape as well as duplicate values and null values in our dataset and also fill null value with 0. Afterthat we check the data summary. We also check datatype and convert object into category. Thereafter we do data visulization. Thereafter we balance our target variable.
